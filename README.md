Zomato Restaurant Clustering And Sentiment Analysis


## Summary
This project entailed the utilization of advanced data analytics techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the restaurants and customer feedback on the popular online food delivery platform, Zomato.

The data procured included information such as the restaurant's name, location, cuisines, ratings, and user reviews.

The initial phase of this project involved rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the data's suitability for comprehensive analysis. Then conducted the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on both datasets, providing insights into the dataset's composition and features.

The next step in the project was the implementation of clustering on the restaurant data through the use of the k-means algorithm. The objective of the clustering was to group similar restaurants together and discern patterns within the data. The features employed for the clustering process included cuisines, average cost and average rating. The number of clusters was determined by utilizing the elbow method.

Then proceeded to conduct sentiment analysis on the user reviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of the overall sentiment towards the restaurants. Certain libraries were utilized to classify the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

The outcome of the analysis revealed that the restaurants within the city were grouped into ten clusters based on their cuisines and average cost. The sentiment analysis uncovered that, generally, customers held a positive sentiment towards the restaurants.

In conclusion, this project exemplifies the utility of clustering and sentiment analysis in gaining a more profound comprehension of restaurant data on Zomato. The insights procured from the analysis can be of immense benefit to both restaurants and customers in making informed decisions. Furthermore, the project can be extended to other cities or even countries to gain insight into the eating habits and preferences of individuals in different regions.

## Conclusion

Clustering and sentiment analysis were performed on a dataset of customer reviews for the food delivery service Zomato. The purpose of this analysis was to understand the customer's experience and gain insights about their feedback.

The clustering technique was applied to group customers based on their review text, and it was found that the customers were grouped into two clusters: positive and negative. This provided a general understanding of customer satisfaction levels, with the positive cluster indicating the highest level of satisfaction and the negative cluster indicating the lowest level of satisfaction.

Sentiment analysis was then applied to classify the review text as positive or negative. This provided a more detailed understanding of customer feedback and helped to identify specific areas where the service could be improved.

Overall, this analysis provided valuable insights into the customer's experience with Zomato, and it could be used to guide future business decisions and improve the service. Additionally, by combining clustering and sentiment analysis techniques, a more comprehensive understanding of customer feedback was achieved.
